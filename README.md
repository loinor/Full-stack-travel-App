# Travel Log
________
#### This app is designed to visualize your travel tracking. Now the app has basic functionality, but in the future, I plan to make an authorization system so that it is possible to view the profile of another user and their routes. The UI will improve, but it just takes more time. Also, I plan to do additional routing and methods on the server side.
________
To install the app you need:
- Make a clone of the repository on your computer.
 ```git clone https://github.com/loinor/Full-stack-travel-App```
- Go to the```server``` folder and start the server using the```npm run dev```command
- Go to the```client``` folder and launch the client using the```npm run start```command

TO DO LIST:
- [ ] Make a demo with git.io
- [ ] Make an additional request "DELETE"
- [ ] Make a Authtorization
- [ ] Make a better UI
    - [ ] Change Popup design to add a point log
    - [ ] I think better way is relocate Popup to left or right side
    - [ ] Make a dynamic change of size marker
